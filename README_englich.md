# ArmTours Dashboard

## Project Description

As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I developed a dashboard called **"ArmTours"**. This system is aimed at tourists or solo travelers who wish to plan their trip to Armenia independently and efficiently. It provides all the necessary information to help plan a trip. While the focus is currently on Armenia, the system is designed in such a way that it can be easily extended to other countries.

The dashboard displays Armenia's oldest churches and culturally significant landmarks. In addition to historical information, practical travel data such as addresses, opening hours, and additional tips are provided. The goal of the project is to spark interest in Armenia among people who know little about the country. Since Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity as a state religion, a special focus is placed on presenting the oldest churches. However, other notable places are also included to further attract travelers' interest.

## Installation Guide

Currently, the system works only locally. To run the system, the following tools need to be installed:

- **Docker Desktop**: To run all three containers (_Frontend_, _Backend_, _Database_) simultaneously.
- **Docker Compose**: To define and manage multi-container applications.
- **npm**: Node Package Manager for managing frontend dependencies.

### Steps to Run:

1. **Start Docker Containers:**

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
